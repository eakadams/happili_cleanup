# happili_cleanup
Clean up Apercal files on happili

September 2022: Have expanded for 
:
- a full selfcal cleanup (keep zipped models of lest seflcal and vis only)
- Keep final continuum images and residuals, compress masks and models
- Remove calibrator vis (previously done manually)

NOTE! This can take a while to run, so best to do in a screen.
